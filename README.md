# NS illustration pack

Hello everyone, my name is Nikolai Sobolev, I am engaged in creating a low poly illustration in blender and decided to create an open-source illustration pack.

This pack includes about 20 illustrations (not counting the variations), some of these illustrations were made by me specifically for the pack and some are a bonus, some of my old works that I decided to put in open source. Initially, the pack was supposed to be bigger, but I decided to take a break in its creation, so I decided to put it in the form that I was not planning so far.

Examples of illustrations:
